My Websites
=======
##### Welcome to the GitHub Repository for my all of my current web projects!
This repository is a collection of all of the basic websites I have authored. They are composed of mainly PHP or raw html (as well as css and javascript of course). There are multiple projects here (each has their own folder) but they are all very basic and for testing purposes only. Also, keep in mind that this code is currently designed to run on my local XAMPP server so it is not for public use.<br /><br />I have written 90% of this code but I have looked to many guides and tutorials for inspiration. Feel free to use any of this code and I am open to any constructive feedback anyone has to offer.<br /><br />
Thanks, PeteyDog7
